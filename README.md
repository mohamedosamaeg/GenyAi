GENY AI – Image Generator

GENY AI is a web application that generates images from text prompts using artificial intelligence.
The project is built with a client–server architecture to ensure security and scalability.

The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend is built with Node.js and Express.
All image generation requests are handled securely on the server using the OpenAI Images API, with the API key stored in environment variables and never exposed to the client.

This project follows modern web development and API security best practices and is intended for learning, experimentation, and portfolio demonstration.
